# SQL-Study
A website that teaches people how to use and build relational databases using SQL. This was the final capstone project of Bryce Randolph, Jeannie Davis, Kevin Robell and Harsandeep Singh. The site was built using Bootstrap and JQuery for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. You can view the website deployed to Heroku [here](https://sqlstudy.herokuapp.com/).

### Goal
The goal of this project is to teach people how to use and build the most popular type of relational databases in use today which are SQL databases. To accomplish this goal we built a website that acts like a one-stop shop for anyone and everyone who wants to learn more about databases. Starting with basics like simply accessing and updating them all the way to designing them from scratch. In order to teach these things the website has three branches of content that work together. These sections are the sandbox, lectures, and quizzes. The website is free to use with an emphasis on collaboration and open source components. We believe that this will lower the barrier to entry for prospective students who wish to learn more about MySQL.

### Building the project
- Initialize the project by typing `npm install`.
- Build the project by typing `npm run build`.
